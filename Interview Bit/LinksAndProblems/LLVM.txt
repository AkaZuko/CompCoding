====== LLVM ======
Created Friday 08 April 2016
Once we have the AST of code it is represented in the LLVM Intermediate representation ( LLVM IR ) 
1. generates SSA
2. infinite number of registers can be used.
3. there is control flow diagram
4. @ is used for global vars
5. % is used for local vars

In the example given in the slides, SSA is global var where the val is incremented upon every variable printing.

Eg : for addition we can have : fprintf(f_llvm, " %%add = add nsw i32 %%%d, %d\n", OP1, OP2 )  : refer online
